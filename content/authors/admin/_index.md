I am a Research Associate in the [High Energy Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/hep/) group of the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk) (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge, where I am also an affiliate of [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk).

Much of my recent work has been concerned with the construction and study of certain quantum mechanical models that provide models of quantum gravity via holography. Such models provide a rich and relatively tractable arena to probe quantum black hole physics. I am also interested in generalised notions of symmetry in quantum field theory, and how they can help us open new windows to otherwise-inaccessible UV physics.

Outside of research, I am involved in a few different outreach activities, through which I hope I can help to tackle some of the serious inequities in high energy theory. This included an annual physics workshop and stall at Green Man Festival in the Brecon Beacons - come and say hi! I have also worked with King's College Maths School on string theory projects for sixth-formers.
