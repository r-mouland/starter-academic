abstract: We construct a general asymptotically locally AdS$_7$ stationary black hole solution of 7d maximal gauged supergravity with three angular momenta and two electric charges. When embedded in 11d supergravity the black hole describes the backreaction of N coincident rotating M5-branes. We study the thermodynamic properties of the black hole and present explicit expressions for its entropy, energy, electric charges, and angular momenta. We show that in the supersymmetric limit of the solution its entropy and on-shell action precisely agree with the result for the path integral of the holographically dual 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT on $S^1 \times S^5$ to leading order in the large N limit.
