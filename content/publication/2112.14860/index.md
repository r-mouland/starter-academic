abstract: We discuss non-Lorentzian Lagrangian field theories in $2n-1$  dimensions that admit an $SU(1,n)$ spacetime symmetry which includes a scaling transformation. These can be obtained by a conformal compactification of a $2n$-dimensional Minkowskian conformal field theory. We discuss the symmetry algebra, its representations including primary fields and unitarity bounds. We also give various examples of free theories in a variety of dimensions and a discussion of how to reconstruct the parent $2n$-dimensional theory.
